Privacy Policy — Sudoku (by UzorGame)

Last updated: October 28, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how UzorGame (“we”, “our”, “us”) handles information in the mobile game “Sudoku”.

We designed the app to work without creating accounts and without uploading your gameplay data to our servers. Game progress and settings are stored locally on your device.

1) What data is processed
We do not directly collect personal data

We don’t ask for your name, email, phone, contacts, or precise location, and we don’t run our own analytics servers.

Advertising (Google AdMob)

Our game shows ads provided by Google AdMob. For ad delivery, measurement, fraud-prevention and abuse detection, Google and its ad partners may process:

device and app information (app version, OS, model),

advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID),

IP address and coarse location,

ad interactions (impressions, clicks, rewards).

Ad personalization depends on your consent and device settings.
Google’s use of data is governed by Google’s policies (see links below).

If you decline personalized ads, we will request non-personalized ads. Google may still process limited data (e.g., to combat fraud and measure delivery).

2) Consent in EEA/UK (UMP)

For users in the EEA and the UK, on first launch we use Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to collect your advertising consent according to the IAB TCF. Your choice is stored by Google’s SDK and applied to ad requests.

You can change your choice anytime in the game: Settings → Privacy (opens the UMP privacy options form).

3) Children’s privacy

Our game targets a general audience and is not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact uzorplay@gmail.com
 and we will address it promptly.

If we ever enroll the app in Google Play’s Families program, we will follow all additional AdMob/Play requirements for child-directed apps.

4) Data storage & retention

We do not maintain user databases and do not store gameplay on our servers.

Ad-related data is handled by Google and retained per Google’s policies.

You can reset your Google Advertising ID in Android settings at any time.

5) Data sharing / “sale”

We do not sell or trade your data.

Ad data is processed by Google AdMob and its certified partners solely to show and measure ads and prevent abuse, under their policies and your consent choices.

For California users: we do not “sell” personal information as defined by the CCPA. To limit ad personalization, use in-app Privacy options, Android Ads settings, and Google Ads Settings (links below).

6) Legal bases (EEA)

Where GDPR applies, processing by Google for ads is based on your consent (for personalization) or legitimate interests (e.g., basic measurement, security, fraud-prevention). We ourselves do not perform separate processing beyond what’s described here.

7) Your choices & controls

In-app: Settings → Privacy (UMP privacy options form).

Device: Android Settings → Privacy / Ads → Reset or limit ad personalization.

Google Ads Settings: manage ad personalization across Google services.

8) Security

We don’t run user databases. Ad delivery and measurement are handled by Google, which applies industry-standard security controls. Keep your device and OS updated to protect your data.

9) Changes to this policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. The latest version is always available at:
